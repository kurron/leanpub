## As a Developer I want to be able to quickly create a skeleton for my new micro-service

> *Dear JVM Guy, normally I get pretty excited when starting a new project but one of the first tasks that needs to be
done is no fun at all: initial set-up.  A build file has to be created, skeleton classes, tests and configuration files
need to placed in the proper folders and I always have to look up the machine names of the various servers involved,
such as the Artifactory server.  All this stuff is necessary but really, really boring to do.  I just want to get
started coding, not spend all my time setting up!  Is there something that can be done to make things easier?*

**The JVM Guy Recommends: lazybones**

Well, Impatient, you are in luck.  There is a simple tool called [lazybones](http://nowhere.org) that can really speed
up the process of spinning up a new project.  It is easy to install and very simple to use.  It gives you access to
the numerous templates in the public domain but the real power is evident when you provide your own template.  Invest
an hour or so crafting your own template and you will be able to set up a project in seconds!

To ease installation, I recommend using [GVM](http://nowhere.org).  Simply type `gvm install lazybones` and you are
off to the races.  The first thing you'll want to do is to verify that lazybones is working.  Type `lazybones list`
to get a listing of templates that lazybones knows about.
