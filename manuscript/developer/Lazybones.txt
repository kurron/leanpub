**Using Lazybones To Bootstrap A New Project**

**The JVM Guy Recommends: [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/) and [lazybones](https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones)**

Dear Constantly Copying, I think I have a solution for you: lazybones.  This Groovy-based tool allows you to define a
customized template, store it in the cloud, and share it with your peers.  The mechanics are very simple and can be
used to template almost any project type. The steps go something like this:

* create a template directory structure
* provide a version file
* publish the template to the cloud
* tell all of your friends

It really is that simple. Before we can create our template, we need to get lazybones installed and that is where
`SDKMAN!` comes into play.  The Software Development Kit Manager is a nice utility that helps ease the pain of
installing some of the commonly used JVM tools, such as Gradle, Vert.x, Spring Boot and, of course, lazybones.
Installing SDKMAN! is trivial on a Linux box.

{title="Installing SDKMAN! on Linux"}
~~~~~~~~ 
curl -s http://get.sdkman.io | bash
~~~~~~~~ 

The shell script will modify your `.bashrc` file, making SDKMAN! and all its goodness available to you.  Try
`sdk install` to see a list of all programs that SDKMAN! can manage.  To install lazybones type `sdk install lazybones`
and follow the prompts.  If things are successful you should be able to type `lazybones --version` and see something
like `Lazybones version 0.7.1`.

I> ## SDKMAN! used to be called GVM

I> SDKMAN! used to be called GVM, the Groovy enVironment Manager.  SDKMAN! has grown in scope and can handle
I> non-Groovy tools, hence the new name.

T> ## Customize SDKMAN!
T>
T> I like to allow SDKMAN! to do as much as it can on its own and not wait for my permission.  I usually create a
T> `.sdkman/etc/config` file with the following contents so that SDKMAN! will automatically stay current.
T>
T> {lang="Bash"}
T> ~~~~~~~~
T> # make sdkman non-interactive, preferred for CI environments
T> sdkman_auto_answer=true
T>
T> # perform automatic selfupdates
T> sdkman_auto_selfupdate=true
T> # configure curl timeouts
T> sdkman_curl_connect_timeout=5
T> sdkman_curl_max_time=4
T> ~~~~~~~~

Once we have lazybones available to us, we'll use it to bootstrap our custom template by issuing the command
`lazybones create lazybones-project 1.1 my-templates`. In this command, I'm specifying a template version to use.  If
the version is omitted, the most current version is used.  The command leaves us with the following directory structure:

~~~~~~~~
my-templates/
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── README.md
└── templates
~~~~~~~~

The template we are creating must go into the `templates` directory and be named using a hyphenated naming structure.
Here we will use an extremely simple example to get you started but this is easily expanded into a much richer template
specific to your needs. Our template will be named `simple-groovy-project` and contains just a few files and folders.

~~~~~~~~
my-templates/
├── build.gradle
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── README.md
└── templates
    └── simple-groovy-project
        ├── build.gradle
        ├── gradle.properties
        ├── README
        ├── settings.gradle
        ├── src
        │   ├── main
        │   │   ├── groovy
        │   │   │   └── .retain
        │   │   └── resources
        │   │       └── .retain
        │   └── test
        │       ├── groovy
        │       │   └── .retain
        │       └── resources
        │           └── .retain
        └── VERSION
~~~~~~~~

As you can see the layout is a basic Gradle layout devoid of any source files. The `.retain` files are special marker
files that indicate an empty directory is part of the template.  Just like Git, lazybones only respects files and not
directories.  Once you have your template laid out, you'll need a place to publish it.  Although it is possible to use
the template locally and never publish it, I find it much more useful to have access to my templates from any machine
that has an internet connection.

T> ## Richer Templates
T>
T> Although this simple example only contains a couple Gradle files, a template typically contains a richer variety of
T> files.  Personally, I try to include anything that will help make me productive on a new project. That includes:
T>
T> * example unit test
T> * example integration test
T> * example acceptance test
T> * Gradle file with my typical dependencies already enumerated
T> * reference to the corporate artifact repository
T>
T> You can also take advantage of lazybones' templating engine to replace tokens with values provided at project
T> creation time, such as package names.
T>

A friendly place to host your templates is [Bintray](https://bintray.com/).  Bintray uses a freemium model but, for
hosting our templates, all we need is the free version of the service.  Once you have an account created, you'll need
to create repository.  If you want lazybones to handle the details of publishing your template you'll need to make your
repository of type `Generic`.  Other than that, you can fill in the other details anyway you want.  For this example,
I'll be publishing to a repository named `lazybones`.

The Gradle files at the top of the tree are special because they are generated from the lazybones template and contain
the publishing logic. Before you can publish to Bintray you need to tell Gradle about your Bintray account.  The
simplest way is to modify the `build.gradle` file so that is has your information.

{title="Modified build.gradle", lang="Groovy"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
lazybones {
    repositoryUrl = 'https://api.bintray.com/content/jvmguy/lazybones'
    repositoryUsername = 'jvmguy'
    repositoryApiKey = 'jvm guy API key'
}
~~~~~~~~ 

The information contained in the modified section of the build file is obtained from your Bintray account.

T> ## Externalize your Bintray credentials.
T>
T> A good idea is to modify your `build.gradle` files so that it looks up your credentials from a properties file
T> that **is not stored under source control**. That way, you can safely store your build file under source control
T> and don't have to worry about accidentally checking in your Bintray credentials.
T> 
T> {title="Modified build.gradle using properties", lang="Groovy"} 
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> lazybones {
T>     repositoryUrl = 'https://api.bintray.com/content/jvmguy/lazybones'
T>     repositoryUsername = bintrayUsername
T>     repositoryApiKey = bintrayApiKey
T> }
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> 
T> {title="gradle.properties", lang="Groovy"} 
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> bintrayUsername = jvmguy
T> bintrayApiKey = jvmguyapikey
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> 

Ensure that you have a `VERSION` file in your template.  Without it, lazybones will refuse to publish your template.
The contents do not appear to matter to lazybones other than it must be different from any previously published
templates.  Mine is very simple:

{title="VERSION"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
0.0.1
~~~~~~~~ 

One final step is to go to the Bintray web site and create a new Bintray package.  The only pieces of information that
are required are the package name and the license.  The package name must match the name of the template being
published with a `-template` suffix added to the end.  For example, to publish our template named `simple-groovy-project`
I need to create a Bintray packaged named `simple-groovy-project-template`.  Once the package is created, we should be
able to publish our template using the following command-line:

{title="The lazybones command to publish the simple-groovy-project template"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
./gradlew publishTemplateSimpleGroovyProject
~~~~~~~~ 

Notice that we have converted the hyphen casing of the template name into camel case?  Once the publish is completed,
there is one final step to perform before your template can be used in the wild.  You need to go back to the Bintray
website and confirm that you want the lazybones artifact published.

T> ## Test Your Template Locally
T>
T> You'll want to test your template locally before publishing.  The easiest way to do that it to use the
T> `installAllTemplates` target.
T> 
T> {title="Package and install the simple-groovy-project template"} 
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> ./gradlew installAllTemplates
T> 
T> :packageTemplateSimpleGroovyProject
T> :installTemplateSimpleGroovyProject
T> :installAllTemplates
T> 
T> BUILD SUCCESSFUL
T> 
T> Total time: 5.791 secs
T> 
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> 
T> {title="Testing the new template"} 
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> lazybones create simple-groovy-project 0.0.1 template-test
T> Creating project from template simple-groovy-project 0.0.1 in 'template-test'
T> 
T> This is the contents of the README file.
T> 
T> 
T> Project created in template-test!
T> ~~~~~~~~ 
T> 

Once your template is published and available for the world to see your users will have to tell lazybones about your
repository, which is very simple to do.  Have them create a file called `config.groovy` in the `~/.lazybones` directory
and have it point to your repository:

{title="~/.lazybones/config.groovy", lang="Groovy"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
bintrayRepositories = [ "jvmguy/lazybones", 
                        "kyleboon/lazybones", 
                        "pledbrook/lazybones-templates" ]
~~~~~~~~ 

Once this is done, they should see your template in lazybones' list:

{title="List available templates"}
