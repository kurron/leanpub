**The JVM Guy Recommends: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), Linux, [Packer](https://packer.io/),
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com)**

Dear Constantly Switching, I've been where you are and I think I can help. All you need to do is stop using your real
box for development and switch to a virtualized environment.  Using virtualization allows you to quickly switch between
project setups without having to modify your real machine.  However, before you can switch to a virtualized environment
you'll have to get a basic understanding of a few technologies.

Q> ## Using Linux as your development OS
Q>
Q> Do I have to ditch Windows for Linux?  In a word -- yes.  It's not that Windows is bad, its just that tooling works
Q> so much better with Linux than Windows.  In addition, it has been my experience that many applications are deployed
Q> to virtualized Linux environments in production so why not develop the skills to work with those servers by
Q> experiencing Linux as you develop?

The free hypervisor VirtualBox is an excellent tool that I have been successfully using for many years and allows you
to run almost any operating system you want.  Somebody, however, still has to install the OS and applications.  That
is where Vagrant comes in.  Vagrant understands VirtualBox's command-line tools and orchestrates the installation of
the OS and applications.  It does so by loading what Vagrant calls a `base box`. A base box is an image of a
pre-configured OS, usually pulled down from Vagrant's registry in the cloud.  I, however, prefer to create my own base
box configured just the way I want.  Luckily, that process can also be automated using Packer.  Tweaking the base box
for particular environments, such as installing IntelliJ or a JDK is automated using the Ansible provisioner. Once you
set up the descriptors for these you'll be able to generate virtual environments quickly and reliably.   Let's put all
these tools to work.

Q> ## Using VirtualBox as the hypervisor
Q>
Q> Is VirtualBox my only option? Absolutely not.  You can use any hypervisor you have access to, such as VMWare, but
Q> you probably want to check the Vagrant documentation and verify that your hypervisor is supported.  The same can be
Q> said for Ansible.  If you are more comfortable with Salt, Puppet or Chef then use one of those tools.  The tool
Q> chain isn't what is important -- *the use of virtualization is*.

**Using Packer To Create Custom Vagrant Base Boxes**

To recap, the goal is to create a tuned development environment using as much automation as possible.  The first step
is to create a base box that can be used as the foundation for our development environments.  The base box I like to
use is built upon Xubuntu 14.04 and Docker.

The Packer documentation does a good job explaining how to set things up so I'll concentrate on the major pieces. First
up is the Packer template file.  It is a JSON file that tells Packer where to grab the OS image to boot up and what
provisioners to apply against the running machine.  The template is difficult to view in book form so I suggest you
visit the website and [view the Packet template there](http://nowhere.com/).

The Packer documentation is well written so I won't go into great detail here about the file format but I will
highlight items that took me some research to figure out how to do.  First order of business -- how to actually get
Ubuntu installed in automated fashion?  Typically, the Ubuntu installation process is interactive with a human at the
keyboard answering various questions. Obviously, if you want Packer to automate the process you cannot require human
interaction.  Fortunately, Ubuntu supports the notion of a `preseed` file which contains all the answers to the
installer's questions.  All you have to do is to get Packer to tell the installer to use the preseed file.  That is
what all of that odd looking text in the `boot_command` section is.  That text is what a human would have to type in
order to get the installer to perform an automated installation.

{title="Packer Boot Command Snippet", lang="JavaScript"}
~~~~~~~~
"boot_command" : [
    "<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
    "/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
    ...
]
~~~~~~~~ 

Another interesting section of the Packer template file is the `provisioners` section.  Here we are running a few
shell scripts using the `sudo` command to make the box Vagrant friendly and bootstrap Ansible.

{title="passwordless-sudo.sh", lang="Bash"}
~~~~~~~~ 
#!/bin/bash

echo '%sudo    ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD:ALL' >> /etc/sudoers.d/passowrdless
echo 'Defaults !requiretty' >> /etc/sudoers.d/passwordless
chmod 0400 /etc/sudoers.d/passwordless
~~~~~~~~ 

{title="install-ansible.sh", lang="Bash"}
~~~~~~~~ 
#!/bin/bash

# assumes Python and PIP have already been installed via python-setuptools python-dev packages
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible
~~~~~~~~

Once Ansible is added to the box, we can use it to handle the remaining provisioning. In a nutshell, Ansible allows you
to script your provisioning commands and execute them over SSH.  Very easy to set up and extremely useful.

Q> ## Why do we install Ansible into the Vagrant box?
Q>
Q> Normally, you run Ansible on a single networked machine and have it SSH out to any boxes that need provisioning. A
Q> current limitation of Ansible is that it does not support Windows.  To work around this, we install Ansible into the
Q> Linux-base Vagrant box and have Ansible do a local provision.

You dictate to Ansible what the desired state of the machine should be and let Ansible figure out how to make that
happen.  The desired state is described in what is known as a `playbook` which is a YAML file that references the
numerous Ansible modules available to it.  Custom logic can be encapsulated in simple shell scripts or, if you want to
share your logic with others, in a custom Ansible module.  One thing to note is that any custom logic you write should
be created in such a way as to make the steps idempotent.  The baked-in Ansible modules are idempotent and won't do
anything if the desired state is already in place.  Your logic should follow the same pattern.  I didn't do this my
first time out and I ended up with 50 duplicate entries in an `/etc/hosts` file!

This playbook is very simple and installs a handful of packages suitable for a desktop.  Depending on what you decide
to install, provisioning can take several minutes and is typically dictated by your network connection speeds.
Ansible is an extremely powerful tool and we will be using much more of it when build our custom environments.  To be
complete, here is the playbook for our headless boxes.  You'll notice that it is almost identical to the desktop
playbook, installing a slightly different set of packages.

Before we can use our base boxes we must have Packer build them and then install them into Vagrant's cache.  I normally
script this process so I don't fat finger something.

{title="Desktop Build Script: build-trusty-desktop.sh", lang="Bash"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
#!/bin/bash

export PACKER_LOG=activate

packer validate trusty-x64-desktop.json

T> ## Testing configurations can take lots of time
T>
T> Developing the recipe for your particular base boxes involves trial and error which means executing lots of failed
T> builds.  Each build can take quite a while as you wait for ISOs to be downloaded and spun up.  Doing this on a
T> laptop while sitting on the couch chatting with family was how I killed time between builds.  Make sure you have
T> a distraction or two lined up as you go through this process.  Once you have your recipe set up the way you like it,
T> regenerating base boxes will be much simpler and more predictable.

D> ## How much should I bake into my base boxes?
D>
D> It depends on how varied the environments you will be building are.  If you know that only minor customizations
D> are required in your VMs then it might make sense to put all of the common parts into the base box.  That could add
D> up to huge time savings later on because creating your VMs will be quicker due to the small amount of provisioning
D> required.  If your projects are like mine, which vary to a fairly wide degree, it might be safer to keep the base
D> box fairly generic and tolerate longer provision times.  There is no law that says you can only have one or two base
D> boxes.  Once you get the hang of Packer you might find it to your advantage to have base boxes for family of
D> environments.

D> ## Do I have to build a custom base box?
D>
D> Not at all.  You can use the standard base boxes provided by Vagrant itself and provision them from scratch.  It
D> really depends on personal taste and how much provisioning you'll be doing downstream.
D>

Q> ## Should I ever refresh my base boxes?
Q>
Q> I like to refresh my base boxes anytime VirtualBox issues a new release.  This allows Packer to install the most
Q> current VirtualBox Guest Additions into the boxes, saving the downstream provisioners from having to do it.
Q>

Q> ## Do I have to use a provisioning tool to configure my base box?
Q>
Q> If you prefer, you can create a virtual machine by hand in VirtualBox and export it as an appliance.  That appliance
Q> can then be fed into Packer to create the base box.  If you have an unusually complex set up that isn't easily
Q> scripted or if you don't feel like learning a provisioning tool, this may be a good option for you.
Q>

Once we have our base boxes built and installed, the next step is to use Vagrant and create our environments.

**Using Vagrant To Build Our Development Environment**

Now that we have base boxes installed, lets use them.  As with Packer, the documentation for Vagrant is very detailed
so I'll only hit the highlights.  Vagrant is controlled through a Ruby file normally named `vagrantfile`.  It defines
the virtual machines to be created and orchestrates their provisioning. Here is an example `vagrantfile` file.

{title="Vagrant Control File: vagrantfile", lang="Ruby"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.8.1"

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vagrant.host = :detect

    config.vm.boot_timeout = 300
    config.vm.box = "packer/trusty-x64-server"
    config.vm.box_check_update = true
    config.vm.hostname = "blackbox"
    config.vm.graceful_halt_timeout = 60
    config.vm.post_up_message = "Login credentials are vagrant/vagrant"
    config.vm.usable_port_range = 2200..2250

    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
        v.gui = false
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--rtcuseutc", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--hwvirtex", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--nestedpaging", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--vtxvpid", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--largepages", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--acpi", "on"]
        v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--groups", "/Ansible"]
    end

    config.vm.provision "shell", path: "ansible/scripts/run-ansible.sh"
	config.vm.define "rabbitmq" do |rabbitmq|
        rabbitmq.vm.hostname = "rabbitmq"
        rabbitmq.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.44.10"
        rabbitmq.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.name = "example.rabbitmq"
        end
    end
	
    config.vm.define "mysql" do |mysql|
        mysql.vm.hostname = "mysql"
        mysql.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.44.20"
        mysql.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.name = "example.mysql"
        end
    end
	
    config.vm.define "desktop" do |desktop|
        desktop.vm.box = "packer/trusty-x64-desktop"
        desktop.vm.hostname = "desktop"
        desktop.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.44.30"
        desktop.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.gui = true
            v.name = "example.desktop"
            v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "4096"]
            v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--vram", "24"]
            v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "2"]
        end
    end
end
~~~~~~~~ 

I like to set up my boxes so that they are on their own private network.  Each box can see each other but machines on
my work network can't see them.  I find this to be cleanest of the possible network setups but you should explore all
networking options and see what works best for you.  This Vagrant descriptor defines 3 virtual machines: `desktop`,
`mysql` and `rabbitmq`.  Having individual machines instead putting everything inside the desktop makes the environment
look similar to what will be seen in test and production.  I've worked on projects where somebody inevitably assumes
`localhost` on some configuration and causes issues with deployment.  This configuration helps to avoid that scenario.
Once the boxes are spun up, Vagrant delegates to Ansible for the actual provisioning of the machines.  This playbook
is much richer than the one we used for Packer and does not read well so I recommend that you
[visit the website for current file](http://nowhere.com/).

In the playbook, we try and separate provisions, called `plays` by Ansible, into logical groups, eg `all` or
`groovy-developer`.  This makes it easier to share provisions between machines.  For example, if I wanted Java 8
installed on both the `desktop` and `mysql` boxes, I would specify something similar to this in my `inventory.ini` file.

{title="Example of installing Java 8 on two boxes"} 
~~~~~~~~ 
[java-8-box]
desktop
mysql
~~~~~~~~ 

In the actual `inventory.ini` file that I use you'll notice that some of the plays refer to a machines named `nobody`.
I do this so that I can keep all my plays in a single file but disable certain ones for this particular project.  For
instance, one project might use a Groovy, MongoDB stack while another project uses JRuby and PostgreSQL.  I can maintain
one template file and improve my plays over time and only activate the ones I need right now.

{title="Example of a disabled play"}

[tomcat-7-boxes]
nobody

[tomcat-8-boxes]
desktop

T> ## Mixing Ansible with Windows
T>
T> I like to copy any scripts that Ansible uses from its location in the shared Vagrant older to somewhere inside the
T> Linux guest. If you don't, Windows will screw up your file attributes and permission bits and cause problems. Copying
T> the files to the Linux file system and setting the permissions the way you need them will allow your Vagrant setup to
T> be portable between different host operating systems.
