## As a Developer I want to document my micro-service's REST APIs

> *Dear JVM Guy, we're a Spring house and we use REST for most of our APIs.  
> While the quality of our APIs has steadily improved over time, the 
> documentation hasn't.  Inevitably the documentation gets out of sync 
> with the actual implementation causing lost hours of development time tracking 
> down integration failures.  I don't think that a RESTifarian would give 
> our APIs high marks but we do incorporate some hypermedia concepts, such
> as providing links to the next state in the workflow.  I've looked at 
> Swagger to help with our documentation but it doesn't support hypermedia 
> and seemed to be really focused on documenting URIs and not the resource 
> itself.  Have you come across a tool or technique that might help us with
> our documentation woes?*
