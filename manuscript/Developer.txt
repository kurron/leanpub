# As a Developer...

## As a Developer I need to quickly create development environments for the multiple projects I work on.

> *Dear JVM Guy, at my company people wear many hats and work on a variety of projects.  I find myself constantly struggling to recreate a working

**The JVM Guy Recommends: VirtualBox, Linux, Packer, Vagrant, Ansible**

Dear Constantly Switching, I feel your pain and I think the solution is well within your reach. All you need to do is stop using your real
box for development and switch to a virtualized one.  The free hypervisor VirtualBox is an excellent tool that I have been successfully 
using for many years.  Using virtualization you can quickly switch between project setups without having to adjust your real machine.  Howevever,
before you can switch to a virtualized environment you'll have to pick up a few technologies. 

A> Do I have to ditch Windows for Linux?  In a word -- yes.  Its not that Windows is bad, its just that tooling works so much better
A> with Linux than Windows.  In addition, it has been my experience that many of the applications are deployed to virtualized Linux 
A> environments so why not develop the skills to work with those servers by experiencing Linux as you develop?

VirtualBox allows you to run almost any operating system you want but somebody still has to install the OS and applications.  That is where 
Vagrant comes in.  Vagrant understands VirtualBox's command-line and orchestrates the installation of the OS and applications.  It does so
by loading what Vagrant calls a base box. A base box is an image of a pre-configured OS usually pulled down from Vagrant's registry in
the cloud.  I prefer to create my own base box configured just the way I want.  Luckily, that process can be automated as well using
Packer.  Tweaking the base box for particular environments, such as installing IntelliJ or a JDK is also automated using the Ansible
provisioner.  Let's put it all together.

A> Do I have to use VirtualBox? Absolutely not.  You can use any hypervisor you have access to, such as VMWare, but you probably want to 
A> check the Vagrant documentation and verify that your hypervisor is supported.  The same can be said for Ansible.  If you are more
A> comfortable with Salt, Puppet or Chef then use one of those tools.  The tool chain isn't what is important -- the use of virtualization
A> is.

To recap, the goal is to create a tuned development environment using as much automation as possible.  The first step is to create 
a base box that we'll use for our environments.  The base box I like to use is built upon Xubuntu 14.04 (Ubuntu Linux using the Xfce 
window manager), using Ansible as the provisioner.

The Packer documentation does a good job explaining how to set things up so I'll concentrate on the major pieces. First up is the Packer
template file.  It is a JSON file that tells Packer where to grab the OS image to boot up and what provisioners to run against the 
running machine.
