**The JVM Guy Recommends: lazybones**

Dear Constantly Copying, I think I have a solution for you: lazybones.  This Groovy-based tool allows you to define a customized template, store it in the
cloud, and share it with your peers.  The mechanics are very simple and can be used to template almost any project type. The steps go something like this:

* create a template directory structure
* provide a version file
* publish the template to the cloud
* tell all of your friends

It really is that simple. I'll give you an extremely simple example to get you started but can expand this into a much richer template specific to your needs.

The first thing we need to do is create simple directory structure which the key folder being the one named `templates`.

As you can see the layout is a basic Gradle layout devoid of any source files.  In the templates I create, I typically populate them with example source
files, such as example Spock tests, Spring context files and a Gradle file with all my typical dependencies already defined.  Like I've said before, you
can pretty much do whatever you want in the template. Once you have your template laid out, you'll need a place to publish it.  Although it is possible
to use the template locally and never publish it, I find it much more useful to have access to my templates from any machine that has an internet connection.

A friendly place to host your templates is Bintray.  Like most web based services, they have a Freemium model but hosting templates all we need is the free
version of the service.  Once you have an account created, you'll need to create repository.  If you want lazybones to handle the details of publishing your
template you'll need to make your repository of type `Generic`.  Other than that, you can fill in the other details anyway you want.  For this example,
I'll be publishing to a repository named `lazybones`.
