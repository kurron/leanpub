**The JVM Guy Recommends: [Spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/)**

Dear Testing, I feel your pain.  I too have struggled with writing automated 
tests.  Some tests were super simple to write and others were more complex 
than the object I was testing!  My breakthrough came when I realized it
was ok to be a polyglot programmer.  At the time I was working on a Java 
project and *assumed* that I had to use Java in my tests as well. Once I
decided that it was okay to look to other JVM languages for my testing needs,
my world opened up.  I looked at JRuby and others but eventually settled on 
Groovy, mainly because of its small learning curve for Java developers.  In the
Groovy space I found an excellent testing tool named Spock and can't recommend 
it enough.  It has allowed the teams I've worked on to breeze through most 
testing tasks. In fact, we cringe when we have to revisit tests written in
Java.  My only complaint about Spock is that its documentation could use some
work but Mr. Haki has filled that void with his 
book [Spocklinght Notebook](https://leanpub.com/spockframeworknotebook).
The book describes everything you need to know so I'll just restrict this
discussion to an example or two of my favorite recipes.

### Data Driven Testing

Sometimes you need to test an algorithm using different data sets.  The 
naive way to accomplish this would be to create multiple tests that differ 
only in the data.  Spock, of course, has a more elegant solution to the
problem.

    @Unroll( 'verify addition where #description' )
    def 'verify addition scenarios'() {

        given: 'valid subject under test'
        def sut = new Adder()

        when: 'two numbers are added'
        def result = sut.add( x, y )

        then: 'expected results are returned'
        result == expected

        where: 
         x  | y || expected
         0  | 0 || 0
         1  | 0 || 1
        -1  | 1 || 0

        description = "x is ${x} and ${y}" )
    }
